Goal of Project:

The goal of this project is to build the most accurate and simplest model, where the firm characteristics will be used as the predictor variables and the results will provide a better understanding of which groups of variables are most significant in predicting:

Number of bids that will lead to a firm getting taken over within 52 weeks of initial bid (BIDNUM)

Probability that number of bids that lead to a firm getting taken over will be less than 2 (BIRY = 0, otherwise = 1).

In other words, the predictive model will allow one to anticipate whether a firm will get taken over within 52 weeks based on information regarding the firm.
